# The AI HEART Project
The AI HEART Project was founded by a small group of independent researchers and user advocates from various backgrounds with the common goal of safe artificial intelligence for everyone. We believe that AI offers great potential to improve the world and to enhance life quality for everyone. However, there are clear risks associated with this advance in technology and the way it is being implemented. These risks, however, can be mitigated if they're given appropriate attention. Our goal is to ensure that AI is safe for people of all ages, races, and backgrounds, including vulnerable and under-represented populations.

Our scope is explore the following categories with regard to AI in order to identify existing risks, foreseeable risks, and to brainstorm possible mitigation strategies. The focus areas of the project include:

- Physical and Psychological Health Risks
- Societal Risks
- Risks to Vulnerable and Under-Represented Populations
- Ethics
- Technical Mitigations

We welcome collaboration with other researchers, organizations, and interested parties. If you would like to get involved or learn more about our work, you can find contact info in [Contact](about.md#contact).

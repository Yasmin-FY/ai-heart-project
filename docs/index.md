# The AI HEART Project
The AI HEART Project was founded by a small group of independent researchers and user advocates from various backgrounds with the common goal of safe artificial intelligence for everyone. We believe that AI offers great potential to improve the world and to enhance life quality for everyone. However, there are clear risks associated with this advance in technology and the way it is being implemented. These risks, however, can be mitigated if they're given appropriate attention. Our goal is to ensure that AI is safe for people of all ages, races, and backgrounds, including vulnerable and under-represented populations.

In comparison, the Industrial Revolution undoubtably brought drastic improvements to productivity, wealth, and comfort, vastly improving the standard of living for everyone. However, these benefits were far from immediate. The rapid urbanization, harsh and dangerous working conditions, low wages, and overcrowding meant a significant decrease in life quality before those long-term benefits could shine through. It wasn't until significant reform and regulation were enacted that the technological and economic progress were able to benefit the average person. Similarly, AI is here and it will have a tremedous impact on society in the coming years. Our goal is to ensure that this transition takes place in a much smoother and more ethical manner than similar technological revolutions of the past.

Our scope is explore the following categories with regard to AI in order to identify existing risks, foreseeable risks, and to brainstorm possible mitigation strategies. The focus areas of the project include:

- Physical and Psychological Health Risks
- Societal Risks
- Risks to Vulnerable and Under-Represented Populations
- Ethics
- Technical Mitigations

We welcome collaboration with other researchers, organizations, and interested parties. If you would like to get involved or learn more about our work, you can find contact info in [Contact](about.md#contact).
